**Greetings Webpage**

This repository contains a simple webpage that allows users to enter a name, select a language using radio buttons, and trigger a greeting based on the selected language. The webpage keeps track of the number of users greeted, ensures that a name is not counted more than once, and preserves the counter between page refreshes using the localStorage feature.

* Input Field: Users can enter their name in an input field.
